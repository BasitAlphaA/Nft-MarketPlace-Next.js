## Steps to Get Started

### 1. Git clone the contracts repo

In its own terminal/command line, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/hardhat-nft-marketplace-fcc
cd hardhat-nextjs-nft-marketplace-fcc
yarn

2. Deploy to Sepolia
After installing dependencies, deploy your contracts to Sepolia:

bash
Copy code
yarn hardhat deploy --network sepolia

3. Deploy your subgraph
Run the following commands to clone and deploy the subgraph:

bash
Copy code
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/graph-nft-marketplace-fcc
cd graph-nft-marketplace-fcc
yarn

Follow the instructions in the README of that repo.

Then, make a .env file and place your temporary query URL into it as NEXT_PUBLIC_SUBGRAPH_URL.

4. Start your UI
Make sure that:

In your networkMapping.json, you have an entry for NftMarketplace on the Sepolia network.
You have a NEXT_PUBLIC_SUBGRAPH_URL in your .env file.
Finally, run:

bash
Copy code
yarn dev

























































This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
